Live example for the following [Gist](https://gist.github.com/missingbinaries/b1e6ed00c25b393116f4d364c9359aac) to help people better understand and implement into their bots.

This repo may look like a bunch of configuration file examples for different libraries but you'll notice that in the .gitignore, the 2nd line states not to included our config file and, as expected (Git Ignore (These files)), it doesn't include it (config.json).

If you'd like to add a library example, feel free! We're open to contributions.
